The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to cycling:
Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the activity of using / riding bicycles, (at least partially) human-powered, wheeled vehicles (typically by foot pedalling), for purposes including transport, recreation, social interaction, exercise, sport, therapy, other purposes, or any combination thereof.Persons engaged in cycling are called cyclists, bikers, or sometimes bicyclists.
They typically either dress for where they are going, or for the cycling, sometimes having another set of clothing with them, or arranged.
Apart from regular two-wheeled bicycles, cycling also includes riding unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, balance bikes, and other similar human-powered wheeled vehicles (HPVs).
Some bicycles are sold with (electric) motors (e-bikes), or other motor assistance.
Cycling is practiced either solo on the vehicle, or with company, including passengers, riding in front, or sitting on the cycle's luggage carrier, or little children and/or pet animals in appropriate seats or such fixed to the bike, or occasionally actually riding with more than one person, cooperatively, on anything from a simple twin / tandem bicycle, to a multi-person party bike.
Cycling is most frequently practiced on-road, but also off-road, either mixed with other traffic, or on distinct cycle lanes, separate, segregated, cycle tracks, or for unattended young children, and in some countries also for adults, on the pedestrians' pavement.
