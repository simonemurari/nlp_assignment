Davies. 1,188 Images include those of pathological specimens, photographs at endoscopy of the bladder and diagrams that explain urological diagnostic procedures. 70 images relate to lesions of the penis and scrotum.

A review in the Postgraduate Medical Journal noted that the X-ray of lung metastases was back to front. Another review considered it a complete work covering everything a urologist could possibly see in their profession. The British Journal of Venereal Disease noted that the book was aimed at urologists but suggested that genitourinary physicians might be interested in it. All three reviews reported that the book was expensive.
