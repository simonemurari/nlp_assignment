The Trevor Project is an American nonprofit organization founded in 1998. Focused on suicide prevention efforts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth, they offer a toll-free telephone number where confidential assistance is provided by trained counselors. The stated goals of the project are to provide crisis intervention and suicide prevention services for youth (defined by the organization as people under 25), as well as to offer guidance and resources to parents and educators in order to foster safe, accepting, and inclusive environments for all youth, at home, schools and colleges.

History
The project was founded in 1998 in West Hollywood, California, by Celeste Lecesne, Peggy Rajski, and Randy Stone. They are the creators of the 1994 Academy Award–winning short film Trevor, a dramedy about Trevor, a gay thirteen-year-old boy who, when rejected by friends because of his sexuality, attempts suicide. When the film was scheduled to air on HBO television in 1998, the filmmakers realized that some of the program's young viewers might be facing the same kind of crisis as Trevor and began to search for a support line to be broadcast during the airing. They discovered that no such helpline existed and decided to dedicate themselves to forming the resource: an organization to promote acceptance of LGBTQ youth, and to aid in crisis and suicide prevention among that group.The Trevor Lifeline was established with seed funds provided by The Colin Higgins Foundation and HBO's license fee. As a result, it became the first nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth. The project also provides online support to young people through the project's website, as well as guidance and resources to educators and parents.
In November 2009, the project was contracted by the Tulare County Suicide Prevention Task Force, located in Tulare County, California. With this agreement, the project received public funds for the first time. In June 2009, seven Tulare County volunteers completed The Trevor Project Lifeguard Workshop Facilitator training. “Lifeguard workshops” have been done in schools in Tulare County municipalities, including Dinuba, Lindsay, Porterville and Visalia, as well as in Hanford in adjacent Kings County.
In 2021, the first openly gay active NFL player, Carl Nassib, used his coming out to also announce a $100,000 donation to The Trevor Project. Additionally, The Trevor Project has been supported by various other celebrities, including Melanie Martinez, Ellen DeGeneres, Troye Sivan, Kathy Griffin, Shay Mitchell, Daniel Radcliffe, Neil Patrick Harris, James Marsden, Chris Colfer, Kim Kardashian, Darren Criss, Dianna Agron, George Takei, Anderson Cooper, and John Oliver.From 2016 to 2022 the CEO of The Trevor Project was Amit Paley. During this period the Trevor Project grew its revenue from $5M to over $60M which included a financial reserve of $50M. In 2019, for the first time in the organization's history TrevorText went from limited operating hours to a 24/7 text and chat counseling services. In October 2022 The Trevor Project launched free digital services in Mexico.In November 2022, The Trevor Project's Board of Directors announced that Amit Paley had been removed effective immediately. The organization's Board of Directors announced that co-founder, Peggy Rajski, would be the interim CEO. Following this news, media outlets also reported that over 200 employees had signed a letter expressing their displeasure with former CEO, Amit Paley, and numerous employees had expressed concerns over the organization's growth and his ability to manage effectively.

Research
The Trevor Project also undertakes mental health research focusing on LGBTQ youth. According to the project's strategic plan, "The Trevor Project will expand the scale of its flagship national survey while continuing to grow visibility and general public consumption of its research; and to incorporate new studies, scientific advances, and research protocols to build on its thought leadership and the impact of its programs." As of 2022, research found that 14% of LGBTQ youth reported a past-year suicide attempt, with LGBTQ youth of color and transgender and nonbinary reporting higher rates illustrating the importance of examining findings intersectionally."

TrevorSpace is carefully monitored by administrators designated by the project to ensure all content is age-appropriate, youth-friendly and factual.

Palette Fund internships are specifically designed to introduce young leaders to the LGBTQ movement.

School workshops

The program also teaches young people to recognize depression and suicide amongst their peers, the impacts of language and behavior on LGBTQ youth, and suicide prevention skills in schools.

On February 10, 2014, YouTube personality Tyler Oakley started a fundraiser to collect $150,000 for the Trevor Project.

Oakley later extended the fundraiser and more than $462,000 had been raised on March 29. On March 31, the fundraiser ended, with a total of $525,754 raised.

In 2001, a New York City-based annual event was added, using entertainers to raise financial resources for the organization. This NYC-based event has had three names, beginning as "A Very Funny Whatever", changing to TrevorNY in 2007 and then to TrevorLIVE New York in 2011.
