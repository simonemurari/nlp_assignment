This article covers the timeline of the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and its outbreaks elsewhere. Flag icons denote the first announcements of confirmed cases by the respective nation-states, their first deaths, and their first secondary transmissions, as well as relevant sessions and announcements of agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders; medical evacuations, visa restrictions, border closures, quarantines, court rulings, and possible cases of zoonosis are also included.

Timeline
Take note that the date of the first confirmations of the disease or any event in a country may be before or after the date of the events in local time because of the International Dateline.

December 2013
Guinea Researchers believe that a 2-year-old boy was the index case of the current Ebola virus disease epidemic. He died in December 2013 in the village of Meliandou, Guéckédou Prefecture. His mother, sister, and grandmother then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. Although Ebola represents a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and was documented in Tai Forest chimpanzees, only one case had been reported in humans in West Africa. With this background and in the context of poor public health systems, the early cases were mis-diagnosed as diseases more common to the area. Thus Ebola virus disease spread for several months before it was recognized as such. In late October 2014, the child was identified as Emile Ouamouno. A tree was later identified in the area where children were known to play with insect-eating Angolan free-tailed bats and hunting and grilling them to eat. Contact with these bats, which are well-known Ebola reservoirs, may have been the immediate cause of the outbreak, though this remains speculative.

March 2014
Guinea On March 18 Guinean health officials announce the outbreak of a mysterious hemorrhagic fever "which strikes like lightning." 35 cases are reported, and at least 23 people died. On March 22, Guinea confirms the fever as Ebola, with 59 possible fatalities.

Mauritania  Since 26 March, Mauritania closed all crossings along the Senegal River, the natural border between Mauritania and Senegal, except for the Rosso and Diama points of entry. Liberia On March 27, the government of Liberia revised its statement from March 24 stating that Ebola was not present within the country -a later report from the WHO reversed the country's position a second time. Senegal On March 28 Senegal closed its border with Guinea in an effort to halt the virus from spreading. Liberia On March 31 the first cases of EVD are confirmed in Liberia, in two patients in Lofa and Nimba counties -they had been the subject of a March 24 press report on EVD  mentioned previously. The patient in Lofa County died on the day of her diagnosis, becoming the first death in Liberia. United States On March 31, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent a five-person team to Guinea for the purpose of aiding the Guinean Ministry of Health and the WHO in containing the outbreak.

UN On August 14 WHO announces that the reports of EVD deaths and cases from the field "vastly underestimate" the scale of the outbreak. Médecins Sans Frontières  On August 15 Doctors Without Borders compares the EVD epidemic to "wartime," and estimates that it will take approximately six months to bring under control. Liberia On August 19, the West Point neighborhood of Monrovia is entirely cordoned off in an effort to halt the spread of EVD in one of the country's worst-affected areas. Liberia On August 20 Liberian troops in Monrovia fired tear gas and live rounds at citizens attempting to break out of the quarantine of West Point, Monrovia; one adolescent dies of gunshot wounds. United States On August 21 the two first medically evacuated cases in the US (missionaries Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly), having been successfully treated with the experimental therapy ZMapp, are released from Emory University Hospital free of the virus.

September 2014
Ivory Coast On September 1 the Ivory Coast loosens its ban on travel into Liberia by opening several humanitarian corridors between the two countries. Médecins Sans Frontières  On September 2 Doctors Without Borders president Joanne Liu warns the U.N. that the world is losing the battle against EVD, and harshly criticizes a "coalition of inaction." Infectious bodies are rotting in the streets in Sierra Leone, and crematoria rather than new Ebola treatment centers are being built in Liberia. UN Also on September 2, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that the epidemic has endangered harvests and sent food prices soaring in West Africa, a problem it expects to intensify in the coming months. UN  On September 3 the Director-General of WHO, Margaret Chan, remarks at a Washington, D.C. press conference that the EVD epidemic was "the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen," and that it was racing ahead of control efforts. United Kingdom On September 3, the patient previously being isolated at the Royal Free Hospital was released. The patient (who was identified as the British nurse William Pooley) allowed blood to be drawn to treat future patients -the fourth medically evacuated patient in the United States later received his transfusion and successfully recovered. (The transfusion may have contributed). United States On September 4, the United States received its third medically evacuated case -a Massachusetts physician, Rick Sacra, had been working in Liberia for Serving In Mission and had performed Cesarean sections on Ebola patients before revealing symptoms. He was treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, where he was given a blood transfusion from the first successfully recovered American patient Kent Brantly. Liberia On September 8, the WHO reported that EVD was present in fourteen out of Liberia's fifteen counties. The remaining county without confirmed cases is Grand Gedeh County.

The doctor (whose identity has not been released) was working in Sierra Leone for the WHO and had begun treatment at Emory University Hospital. In order to recover from the virus, the patient was scheduled to receive serum from the British medically evacuated case William Pooley. Australia On September 17, Australia donated 7 million Australian Dollars to the British government, the WHO, and MSF for the purpose of aiding the countries affected by the EVD outbreak. MSF declined the offer, stating that military and medical help were more crucial to their effort than financial support. UN On 18 September  the UN General Assembly and the Security Council approve resolutions creating the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), the first time in history the UN has created a mission for a health emergency. Guinea Also on September 18 it is reported that eight health workers and journalists were killed by villagers in Womey, Nzérékoré Prefecture; their bodies were dumped in a septic tank.

Nigeria On September 22, the WHO reported an overall total of 20 cases and 8 deaths in Nigeria. There have been no new cases since the announcement thus far, and so EVD appears to be contained there. Liberia On September 22, a new 150-bed treatment center was opened in Monrovia, with patients arriving the day of its establishment. United States On September 24, the first EVD case in the United States (Thomas Eric Duncan) visits the emergency room of the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, where he is diagnosed with a 'low-grade, common viral disease' and sent home with antibiotics. Spain On 25 September it was announced that Brother Manuel García Viejo, the second Spanish citizen infected with the virus, had died at Madrid's Hospital Carlos III. United States On September 25, the third medically evacuated case in the US was released from the Nebraska Medical Center after three weeks of isolation. The patient, Rick Sacra, successfully convalesced with a blood transfusion from another American case. United Nations  On September 26, the WHO announces that "The Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times. Never before in recorded history has a biosafety level four pathogen infected so many people so quickly, over such a broad geographical area, for so long." United States On September 28, Thomas Eric Duncan is isolated at the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, where nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are exposed to Duncan's vomit and bodily fluids. Both later become the second and third cases of EVD within the United States. Ivory Coast On September 29, the Ivory Coast concluded its ban on flights from Liberia citing 'West African solidarity.'

Spain On October 10 María Teresa Romero Ramos's mixed breed dog, Excalibur, is
euthanized by regional court order despite public protests due to concerns that it may have been an animal reservoir of the Ebola virus. On Twitter, the hashtag #SalvemosaExcalibur  (We'll Save Excalibur) was briefly the second-most popular hashtag worldwide. Ivory Coast On October 10, the Ivory Coast banned the sale of bush meat as part of a series of limitations designed to prevent EVD from spreading to the country. Bush meat has been generally accepted as one of the reservoirs of the virus and has been restricted temporarily in Nigeria as well.

Senegal was announced 'Ebola-free' on the same day. Médecins Sans Frontières  Also on October 17, Doctors Without Borders avers that international pledges of donations have had no impact on the situation in West Africa, and that it was "ridiculous" that MSF was bearing the brunt of care. United States Also on October 17, President Barack Obama names Ron Klain as his point man on the Ebola epidemic.Also on October 17, several school closures in Ohio and Texas (connected with the two flights taken by Amber Vinson) by school district officials are declared by public health officials to be an overreaction. The CDC and Frontier Airlines widen their search, however, to 800 people who afterwards had boarded the same airliner  (an Airbus A320, plane number N220FR) before it was taken out of service. The Airbus had flown to Atlanta, Georgia and Ft.

United States Also on October 30, Science and Science Translational Medicine offer their articles on the Ebola epidemic for free for both the public and for researchers given that it is "unprecedented in terms of number of people killed and rapid geographic spread." United States On October 31 Maine Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere ruled that nurse Kaci Hickox (who had previously gone on a defiant bicycle ride, breaking her quarantine) must continue to undergo mandatory monitoring by public health officials, but that her movements were not to be restricted inasmuch as she was asymptomatic. "The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational,' the judge noted. United Nations By the end of October, WHO statistics showed 13,540 cases and 4,941 deaths overall.

November 2014
France On November 1, the second medically evacuated case was flown out of Sierra Leone to be treated in France. The patient, a United Nations employee, is not a French citizen.
