In artificial intelligence, a behavior selection algorithm, or action selection algorithm, is an algorithm that selects appropriate behaviors or actions for one or more intelligent agents. In game artificial intelligence, it selects behaviors or actions for one or more non-player characters. Common behavior selection algorithms include:

Finite-state machines
Hierarchical finite-state machines
Decision trees
Behavior trees
Hierarchical task networks
Hierarchical control systems
Utility systems
Dialogue tree (for selecting what to say)

Related concepts
In application programming, run-time selection of the behavior of a specific method is referred to as the strategy design pattern.
