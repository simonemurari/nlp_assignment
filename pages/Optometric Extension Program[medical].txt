The Optometric Extension Program Foundation (OEPF) is an international, non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of the discipline of optometry, with recent emphasis on behavioral optometry and vision therapy.The story of OEPF started over 130 years ago, when Dr. A.M. Skeffington, the father of behavioral optometry, was born in Kansas City, Missouri.
Dr. Skeffington taught us many thingsâ€¦:

Vision is a learned skill that emerges.
Ocular discomfort occurs when visual achievement gets to the point of being unsatisfactory or becomes unacceptable to the person.
Through proper training, people can see more efficiently.OEPF was founded in 1928 by A.M. Skeffington and E.B. Alexander.
E.B. Alexander, was Executive Director of the Optometric Extension Program: The organizational force behind the Foundation and a visionary optometric pioneer.

The OEP Foundation has its origins in a continuing education post graduate program developed by the Oklahoma Optometric Association for its members in the 1920s. Optometrists E.B. Alexander (the secretary of the Oklahoma Extension Program) and A.M. Skeffington ("the father of behavioral optometry") have been credited as establishing the OEP Foundation in 1928. The OEP Foundation began with 51 members and has developed into an international organization with 12,000+ participants. It offers a certification program for optometrists and therapists. [1]

The story of OEPF is, however, not a story of either of the two men. 
OEPF is the only optometric foundation that publishes specialized books and journals for the profession. Four times per year, the Foundation publishes Optometry & Visual Performance (OVP). OVP is a free, international, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the advancement of the role of optometry in enhancing and rehabilitating visual performance.
OEPF has always been built upon clinicians sharing with clinicians, veteran practitioners guiding those new to the profession or new to behavioral vision care. Therefore research is very important.

OEPF's Mission
To advance human progress through research and education on vision, the visual process, and clinical care.

OEPF's Goals
To foster a positive environment to advance human progress on vision, the visual process, and clinical care through research, education, and a dynamic network of professionals. OEPF commits to thinking long-term about the well-being of the organization and shares the passion of behavioral/developmental vision to provide for the visual welfare of the patients we serve. OEPF is a community that shares knowledge and supports one another, valuing driven determination in all members of our family.

OEPF's Definition of Behavioral Optometry
Behavioral optometry is a special branch of optometry. It deals scientifically and therapeutically with the development and quality of vision and basic visual functions. In the case of disorders of visual functions that occur in healthy eyes and brain (the disorders can be consequences of a disease), the impaired functions are analyzed and trained using individual systematic exercises (visual therapy) and optical corrections.

Description:
Behavioral optometry, also known as developmental optometry or functional optometry, is a specialized area within optometry that focuses on the relationship between vision and behavior. It goes beyond standard eye examinations and refractive error correction (such as prescribing glasses or contact lenses) to consider how visual processes affect a person's overall functioning and well-being. Behavioral optometrists assess and treat various vision-related issues, especially those that may impact learning, development, and daily activities.
It is a recognized field within optometry. Behavioral optometrists often address conditions or concerns related to:

Binocular Vision Disorders: These are issues with how the eyes work together, such as strabismus (eye misalignment) or convergence insufficiency (difficulty bringing the eyes together to focus on near objects).
Amblyopia (Lazy Eye): Behavioral optometrists may provide therapy and treatments to improve vision in individuals with amblyopia.
Vision-Related Learning Problems: They assess how visual issues might be contributing to reading difficulties, attention problems, and other learning challenges.
Visual Rehabilitation: Behavioral optometrists work on vision therapy and exercises to improve eye coordination, tracking, and visual perception.
Visual Stress: They may address issues related to eye strain, discomfort while reading or using screens, and other visual discomfort.
Sports Vision: Some behavioral optometrists work with athletes to enhance their visual performance in sports.
Research:
Studies and research findings that suggest the effectiveness of vision therapy, particularly for certain specific conditions. Examples of a few areas where positive scientific evidence for vision therapy exists:

Convergence Insufficiency (CI):
A large-scale randomized clinical trial known as the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) found that office-based vision therapy combined with at-home therapy was more effective than placebo therapy (in-office placebo treatments) for improving symptoms and clinical signs of convergence insufficiency in children and adults.
The CITT study also demonstrated that vision therapy can lead to significant improvements in reading performance and related symptoms for individuals with CI.
Amblyopia (Lazy Eye):
Some studies have shown that vision therapy, often combined with patching or atropine eye drops, can improve visual acuity and stereopsis (depth perception) in individuals with amblyopia.
The Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) has conducted several studies that support the use of vision therapy as an effective treatment option for amblyopia.
Strabismus (Eye Misalignment):
Vision therapy is often used as an adjunctive treatment for certain types of strabismus, especially when the eye misalignment is associated with poor eye teaming or binocular vision problems.
Studies have shown that vision therapy can help improve binocular vision and alignment in some cases of strabismus.
Accommodative Disorders:
Research suggests that vision therapy can be beneficial for individuals with accommodative disorders, where there are difficulties with focusing on near objects for extended periods.
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):
Some studies have explored the use of vision therapy in the rehabilitation of patients with traumatic brain injuries. Vision therapy can help address visual deficits and improve visual comfort in some TBI patients.
