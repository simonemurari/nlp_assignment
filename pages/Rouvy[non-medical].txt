ROUVY is an indoor cycling app that combines real 2D outdoor video footage of thousands of cycling routes, including load and height profile, with artificially created augmentations. including rider avatars. This creates a 3D virtual environment - the so-called augmented route. This is then viewed on a screen (TV screen, computer, or mobile phone) while the rider is sitting on their indoor training bike. Riders can use a "smart trainer" to replicate a real life ride as resistance in the bike is increased or decreased to simulate the actual gradient encountered on the augmented route. Thanks to this interconnectedness, ROUVY provides a relatively realistic riding experience for cyclists from their own home.The app allows a variety of cycling activities for riders such as hill climbing, time trials, races, group rides, structured training plans and interval training. The app also provides detailed performance data and analytics, allowing riders to track their progress over time.
