Production
The film was a co-production between ABC-TV and William Goetz. It was shot in Israel and London.  It was intended that the film be released as two one-hour episodes for TV in the US and as a feature in other countries. Part one was to be called David the Outlaw; part two David the Hunted."It's a simple story," said Chandler "only half a dozen people in it. There'll be no chariot race." Filming took place in Israel in August and September 1960; Israel troops guarded them near the Jordan border. The unit then shifted to Elstree studios in London. Filming had completed by October.During filming Chandler met David Ben Gurion.

Release
ABC could not find a sponsor for the program. It eventually screened on ABC as a Sunday night movie in 1962. The film drew record high ratings and prompted ABC to commission a series Great Bible Stories.
