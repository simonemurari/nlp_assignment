Sandero R.S. 2.0
In August 2014, Renault Sport CEO Patrice Ratti revealed to the Autocar magazine that a hot hatch R.S. version of Sandero was in the works, following development mules being spotted in early to mid 2015. Using the 150 hp (110 kW) 2.0 16v F4R engine, and capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.0 seconds and reaching a top speed of 202km/h (126mph), the Sandero R.S. is the first Renault Sport vehicle to be manufactured outside France. It was released in September 2015 in Brazil, different from the normal versions with three types of ECU control: normal, sport and sport+, four disc brakes with ABS, a steering wheel taken from the Clio R.S., electronic stability program and a six speed manual transmission.It later came in Mexico on 21 October 2019.The Sandero RS is discontinued at the end of 2021 because of Brazilian emissions standards.

Facelift
The revised Dacia Sandero was released in November 2016 at the 2016 Paris Motor Show. On the outside, the facelifted version comes with LED daytime running lights and restyled taillights. Dacia has also updated its engine range with a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder petrol that sits in the entry-level trims, replacing the old 1.2-litre unit.
Another facelift was announced in July 2019, to be introduced for the following model year, but only for the Renault-badged model, produced in Brazil. This upgrade brings a slightly revised front end and a more significantly redesigned rear end. While the front end is identical with the facelifted Romanian or Moroccan-built Renault Sandero sold in regions outside Latin America, the rear end is majorly revised with the rear tail lights extends to the tailgate. This facelift is not sold in Mexico since it was replaced by the Kwid hatchback and therefore the Stepway and R.S. versions of the Sandero are only sold.

Euro NCAP
In 2021, the Dacia Sandero Stepway in its standard European configuration obtained 2 stars from Euro NCAP.

Top Gear
The Sandero was the focus of a running joke on the British television programme Top Gear. In Series 11 and Series 12, after Dacia sent the show a press kit, presenter James May would often exclaim "Good News!" and explain a fact about the Sandero during the show's news segment, to which Jeremy Clarkson would reply "Great!" before abruptly changing the subject.
The joke was also featured in The Big Book of Top Gear, with a page proclaiming "Good News! The Dacia Sandero is in this book!" In later episodes, the presenters switched sides of the joke, with Clarkson bringing up news about the car and May shrugging it off. In the first episode of Series 13, when May said he had "Good News", Clarkson immediately asked "Is it the Dacia Sandero?", to which a seemingly bewildered May replied, "No..." The car was not mentioned for the remainder of the series.
In Series 14, during a visit to Romania, Clarkson bought May a used Sandero as a gift. After returning from a test drive, May parked the car behind an idling lorry and exited. As May praised the car to his co-presenters, the lorry reversed into the Sandero, damaging the passenger side. The joke was continued in Series 15, except this time referring to the Dacia Duster, and in Series 18, when May brought up the new Dacia Lodgy. The joke returned in the first and third episodes of Series 19, as well as the second and fifth episodes of Series 20.
The second generation Sandero was featured alongside the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Up! in series 21 as part of a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder cars challenge, which ended with Clarkson (Up!) and May (Sandero) having to drive into the abandoned city of Pripyat, with Richard Hammond's Fiesta having already run out of fuel. The Sandero was the only car to make it back out and complete all the challenges. (Technically, the challenge was to run out of fuel before reaching Pripyat, so Hammond in his Fiesta was successful at this last challenge.) May pointed out the large price difference between the Fiesta and the Sandero, stating that at Â£17,500 vs. Â£7,500 he could afford to lose his car, buy another, and still be better off than Hammond.Despite the comical and sarcastic nature of the recurring bit, May has stated that he has a genuine affinity for the Sandero. According to some sources, its second generation was intended to become a third Reasonably Priced Car on Top Gear, however its use was prevented due to its delayed release in Britain.
