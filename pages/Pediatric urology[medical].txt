Pediatric urologists
In North America, most pediatric urologists are associated with children's hospitals. Training for board certification in pediatric urology typically consists of a surgery internship as part of a urology residency followed by subspecialty training in pediatric urology at a major children's hospital. In India, Pediatric Urology is practiced by Pediatric Surgeons with a special interest/ training in pediatric urology as well as by adult urologists who get trained in Pediatric Urology.
