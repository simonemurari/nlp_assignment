Anthropotechnic is a term used in art, science and literature to denote something with aspects of both man and machine. In this case, it is claimed that the "modified" does not set a limit but instead opens an infinite horizon that is as wide and limitless as human desires. Another conceptualization is that anthropotechnic is a set of rules that we make to tame, teach, and train ourselves. The concept is distinguished from anthropotechnology, which focuses on the study and improvement of working and living conditions.

Applications
Paintings such as Max Ernst's Oedipus Rex are early examples of the use of this quality. In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals. There is a claim that a part of freemasonry, particularly during the 18th century, could also be considered anthropotechnic in the sense that it acted as a caste of technocrats managing society and the human sphere.
