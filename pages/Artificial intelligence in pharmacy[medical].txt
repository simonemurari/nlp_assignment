Artificial intelligence in pharmacy is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the discovery, development, and the treatment of patients with medications. AI in pharmacy practices has the potential to revolutionize all aspects of pharmaceutical research as well as to improve the clinical application of pharmaceuticals to prevent, treat, or cure disease. AI, a technology that enables machines to simulate human intelligence, has found applications in pharmaceutical research, drug manufacturing, and patient-centered services.

Drug discovery and development

AI algorithms analyze vast datasets with greater speed and accuracy than traditional methods. This has enabled the identification of potential drug candidates, prediction of their interactions, and optimization of formulations. AI-driven simulations and modeling assist researchers in understanding molecular interactions, thus expediting the drug development timeline.
