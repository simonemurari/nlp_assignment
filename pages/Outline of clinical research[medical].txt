The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to clinical research:
Clinical research is the aspect of biomedical research that addresses the assessment of new pharmaceutical and biological drugs, medical devices and vaccines in humans.

General topics
Clinical significance – a conclusion that an intervention has an effect that is of practical meaning to patients
Drug discovery – the identification of candidates, synthesis, characterization, screening, and assays for therapeutic efficacy
Drug development – the process of taking a new chemical through the stages necessary to allow testing in clinical trials
Biotechnology – the technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms to make or modify products or processes for specific use
Biopharmaceutical – a drug produced using biotechnology
Clinical trial – an experiment with human subjects to assess safety and efficacy of drugs
Academic clinical trials – clinical trials run at academic centers (e.g., medical schools, academic hospitals, and universities)
Clinical trials unit – biomedical research units dedicated to conducting clinical trials
Epidemiology – the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations
Epidemiological methods – statistical techniques used in epidemiology
Evidence-based medicine – the assessment of the quality of evidence relevant to the risks and benefits of medical treatments
Pharmacology – the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and drugs that alter normal biochemical function
Biopharmacology – the pharmacology of biopharmaceuticals
Clinical pharmacology – the scientific discipline focused on rational drug development and utilization in therapeutics
Pharmacokinetics – the study of the fate of drugs administered to the body
Bioequivalence – the biological equivalence of two preparations of a drug
Pharmacodynamics – the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on the body
Pharmacometrics – the science of interpreting and describing pharmacology in a quantitative fashion
Pharmacovigilance – the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects of medicines

Drug terminology
Active ingredient – the substance in a drug that is pharmaceutically active
Approved drug – a drug that has been approved for marketing by a regulatory body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency
Excipient – an inactive substance used as a carrier for the active ingredients of a drug
Medicinal product – any substance or combination of substances used for treating or preventing disease in humans
Off-label use – the practice of prescribing a drug for an indication for which the drug has not been approved
Orphan drug – a drug used to treat a rare medical condition, or orphan disease
Placebo – a sham treatment given to a control group in a clinical study
Prescription drug – a licensed medicine that can only be obtained by prescription from a doctor
Standard treatment – a currently available drug used in an active control clinical study

Heart Protection Study – the largest study to investigate the use of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
International Studies of Infarct Survival – four randomized controlled trials of several drugs for treating suspected acute myocardial infarction.
Intersalt study – a landmark observational study that showed a strong association between dietary salt and risk of cardiovascular disease.
