This is a list of mnemonics used in medicine and medical science, categorized and alphabetized. A mnemonic is any technique that assists the human memory with information retention or retrieval by making abstract or impersonal information more accessible and meaningful, and therefore easier to remember; many of them are acronyms or initialisms which reduce a lengthy set of terms to a single, easy-to-remember word or phrase.

Mnemonics with wikipages
ABC —  airway, breathing, and circulation
AEIOU-TIPS — causes of altered mental status
APGAR — a backronym for appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration (used to assess newborn babies)
ASHICE — age, sex, history, injuries/illness, condition, ETA/extra information
FAST — face, arms, speech, time (stroke symptoms)
Hs and Ts — causes of cardiac arrest
IS PATH WARM? — suicide risk factors
OPQRST — onset, provocation, quality, region, severity, time (symptom checklist often used by first responders)
RICE — rest, ice, compression, elevation (generic treatment strategy for sprains and bruises)
RNCHAMPS — types of shock

SOCRATES — used to evaluate characteristics of pain
SOAP – a technique for writing medical records
SLUDGE — salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastric upset, and emesis (effects of nerve agent or organophosphate poisoning)

Essential amino acids
"TIM HALL PVT. (Ltd.) always argue and never (get) tire":

Phe – phenylalanine
Val – valine
Thr – threonine
Trp – tryptophan
Ile – isoleucine
Met – methionine
His – histidine
Arg – arginine
Leu – leucine
Lys – lysine
Always argue: A is for Arg (Arginine) not Asp (Aspartic acid).
'Never tire': T is not Tyr (Tyrosine), but is both Thr (Theronine) and Trp (Tryptophan).†Note that this initialism uses single letters for each amino acid that are not the same as the standard single-letter codes commonly used in molecular biology to uniquely specify each amino acid; for example, though phenylalanine is represented here by the letter "P", it is formally represented by the letter "F" in most other contexts, and "P" is instead used to formally represent proline.

Erikson's developmental stages
"The sad tale of Erikson Motors":

The stages in order by age group:Mr. Trust and MsTrust had an auto they were ashamed of. She took the initiative to find the guilty party. She found the industry was inferior. They were making cars with dents [identity] and rolling fuses [role confusion]. Mr. N.T. Macy [intimacy] isolated the problem, General TVT absorbed the cost. In the end, they found the tires were just gritty and the should have used de- spare!
