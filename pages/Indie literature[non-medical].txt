The National Literary Awards defines independent or "indie" literature as "books published outside mainstream publishing."[1] Such books are rarely recognized and hard to pin down, but some examples include "Damastor" by Dimitri Iatrou,  "Returning Home" by Marcus Blake and "Hope...Joy (and a Few Little Thoughts) for Pregnant Teens" by Rachel Brigoni.
