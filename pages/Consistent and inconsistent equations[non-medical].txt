In mathematics and particularly in algebra, a system of equations (either linear or nonlinear) is called consistent if there is at least one set of values for the unknowns that satisfies each equation in the system—that is, when substituted into each of the equations, they make each equation hold true as an identity. In contrast, a linear or non linear equation system is called inconsistent if there is no set of values for the unknowns that satisfies all of the equations.If a system of equations is inconsistent, then it is possible to manipulate and combine the equations in such a way as to obtain contradictory information, such as 2 = 1, or

Both types of equation system, consistent and inconsistent, can be any of overdetermined (having more equations than unknowns), underdetermined (having fewer equations than unknowns), or exactly determined.

  has an infinite number of solutions, all of them having z = 1 (as can be seen by subtracting the first equation from the second), and all of them therefore having x + y = 2 for any values of x and y.

  is inconsistent because the sum of the first two equations contradicts the third one.

Criteria for consistency
As can be seen from the above examples, consistency versus inconsistency is a different issue from comparing the numbers of equations and unknowns.

Linear systems
A linear system is consistent if and only if its coefficient matrix has the same rank as does its augmented matrix (the coefficient matrix with an extra column added, that column being the column vector of constants).
