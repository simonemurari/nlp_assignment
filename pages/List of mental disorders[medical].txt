The following is a list of mental disorders as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
The DSM is the American Psychiatric Association's standard reference for psychiatry, which includes over 450 different definitions of mental disorders. The ICD published by the World Health Organization is the international standard system for classifying all medical diseases. It also includes a section on mental and behavioral disorders.
The diagnostic criteria and information in the DSM and ICD are revised and updated with each new version. This list contains conditions which are currently recognized as mental disorders as defined by these two systems. There is disagreement in various fields of mental health care, including the field of psychiatry, over the definitions and criteria used to delineate mental disorders. Of concern to some professionals is whether certain mental disorders should be classified as "mental illnesses" or whether they would be better described as neurological disorders, or in other ways.
Mental health disorders affect how many people work, act, and function. Broad diagnoses such as anxiety or depression, together with eating disorders, may also serve as umbrella terms for more specific conditions. An example of this would be Separation anxiety disorder, a specific anxiety disorder which exhibits symptoms that may not be present in Generalized anxiety disorder.
