The first edition of the textbook Data Science and Predictive Analytics: Biomedical and Health Applications using R, authored by Ivo D. Dinov, was published in August 2018 by Springer. The second edition of the book was printed in 2023.This textbook covers some of the mathematical foundations, computational techniques, and artificial intelligence approaches used in data science research and applications.Using the statistical computing platform R and a broad range of biomedical case-studies, the 23 chapters of the book first edition provide explicit examples of importing, exporting, processing, modeling, visualizing, and interpreting large, multivariate, incomplete, heterogeneous, longitudinal, and incomplete datasets (big data).

Structure
First edition table of contents
The first edition of the Data Science and Predictive Analytics (DSPA) textbook  is divided into the following 23 chapters, each progressively building on the previous content.

Second edition table of contents
The significantly reorganized revised edition of the book (2023)   expands and modernizes the presented mathematical principles, computational methods, data science techniques, model-based machine learning and model-free artificial intelligence algorithms. The 14 chapters of the new edition start with an introduction and progressively build foundational skills to naturally reach biomedical applications of deep learning.
