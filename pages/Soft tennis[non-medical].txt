Soft tennis is a racket game played on a court of two halves, separated by a net. Soft tennis originated in Japan in 1884. Like regular tennis, it is played by individuals (singles) or pairs (doubles), whose objective is to hit the ball over the net, landing within the confines of the court, with the aim of preventing one's opponent from being able to hit it back. Matches are generally best-of-seven or best-of-nine. Soft tennis differs from regular tennis in that it uses soft rubber balls instead of hard yellow balls.It is played primarily in Asia, especially in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Thailand, and the Philippines. In 2004, soft tennis was introduced into Europe. Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom all now have active soft tennis federations. All of them are also members of the European Soft Tennis Federation, and the International Federation JSTA.

Current situation in Japan
In the 1970s, it was said that "soft tennis is the most popular sport in middle and high school" [6]. Currently, there is a competitive population (registrants) of about 600,000 in Japan. The Japan Soft Tennis Federation estimates that there are about 7 million enthusiasts [7]. However, it is also a fact that the minor feeling is extremely strong in the consciousness of lovers in general. The causes are that it is not an Olympic event, that there have been no professional athletes in Japan for a long time [Note 38] [8], and that it is recognized that school physical education (junior high school, high school) is the main focus [Note 39]. ], The influence of tennis (rigid tennis, lawn tennis) [Note 40], which has rapidly become popular in Japan since the 1980s, is considered.
